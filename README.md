# FHG-IN-PHP

I'm a very good friend with the author of fhg.se and i have taken the honorfull mission to rewrite the entire site in PHP insted of ASP. 

"The foundation for fhg.se comes from the website I made for my own group in Halmstad. The first versions were produced at the end of 2002 and were only intended to be used for external marketing. Pretty soon, the website was further developed with login-protected pages intended only for members. We benefited greatly from being able to collect information that everyone could update and access, so I developed more and more features and expanded the number of uses as I went along." Quote founder of Exortus AB.
# !!!THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL SITE PLEASE USE <a href="https://www.fhg.se">THE ORIGINAL</a>!!!
